# xcode-mode

**xcode-mode** is a minor mode for Emacs to perform Xcode like actions in your iOS projects.

## Keybindings

All keybindings start with `C-c C-x`. All functions in xcode-mode have a two-letter mnemonic shortcut, for instance, build-workspace is `bw`.

Here are all the keybindings:

* `C-c C-x bw` builds the current project workspace.
* `C-c C-x bp` builds the current project project.
* `C-c C-x tw` cleans the current project workspace.
